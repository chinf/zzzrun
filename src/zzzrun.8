.TH ZZZRUN "8" "August 6, 2017" "zzzrun.sh" "System Administration Commands"
.SH NAME
zzzrun \- run command if ZFS pool has no sleeping hard drives
.ds p zzzrun
.ds t @zzzrun-pool
.ds c /var/cache/zzzrun-cache
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B \*p
[\fIoptions\fR]
[\fB-i\fR \fIPOOL\fR]... [\fB-x\fR \fIPOOL\fR]... \fICOMMAND\fR [\fB\*t\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B \*p
checks the standby/sleep status of all rotational drives in the ZFS pools
specified, and only if they are all active/idle runs the command supplied.
Use this utility to avoid spinning up drives unnecessarily.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-p
Check each pool separately and run \fICOMMAND\fR once per pool.
If using this option, use token \fB\*t\fR (see \fICOMMAND\fR parameter)
to update \fICOMMAND\fR for each run, otherwise the command will be
repeated identically for each and every pool.
.IP
Without this option \fB\*p\fR will check all disks across all pools in
scope and then execute \fICOMMAND\fR once if there are no disks in
standby/sleep.
.TP
.B \-u
Force an update of any cached device information.
See DEVICE CACHE section for more details.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.  Report warnings and information.  By default only errors
are reported.
.TP
.B \-vv
Very verbose.  Report debugging messages.
.TP
.B \-i\fR \fIPOOL
Include a pool.
Repeat this option to specify multiple pools.
Any pools that are unavailable will be ignored.
A warning is given if none of the pools are available.
Omit this option to include all pools.
.TP
.B \-x\fR \fIPOOL
Exclude a pool.
Repeat this option to specify multiple pools.
.TP
.I COMMAND
Command to execute if no hard drives in the pool(s) are in standby or
sleep modes.
.IP
Use the substitution token \fB\*t\fR in the command arguments to make
\fB\*p\fR insert the pool scope when running the command.
The token may be used multiple times if required.
If using \fB\*p -p\fR this will be the name of each pool as \fB\*p\fR
iterates through them, otherwise this will be a list of all pools
included.
.SH EXAMPLES
To use
.BR zfs-auto-snapshot (8)
without waking up any sleeping hard drives:
.PP
.nf
.RS
\*p -p zfs-auto-snapshot -qg -l frequent -k 4 \*t
.RE
.fi
.PP
To test \fB\*p\fR on all currently available pools:
.PP
.nf
.RS
\*p -pv echo \*t
.RE
.fi
.PP
To refresh the \fB\*p\fR device information cache without otherwise
executing any command:
.PP
.nf
.RS
\*p -u :
.RE
.fi
.PP
.SH DEVICE CACHE
Device information is cached to avoid unnecessary calls to ZFS
utilities which can cause sleeping drives to wake up.
The default location for the device information cache is:
\fB\*c\fR
.PP
Ideally this should be on a device that is not subject to spin-down.
To change this location, edit the export variable ZZZRUNCACHE in
/etc/profile.d/zzzrun.sh
.PP
As block device names can change between boots, a systemd unit is set up
by the zzzrun installer to reset the device cache at boot time. 
.SH LIMITATIONS
There is currently no mechanism in place to detect pool changes (e.g. 
from \fBzpool import\fR or \fBzpool export\fR commands) to automatically
invalidate the cache, so to avoid errors in these situations, run
\fB\*p -u :\fR afterwards.
.PP
Hard drives that are connected to the host via USB may report their power
state incorrectly to \fBhdparm -C\fR.
USB drives that appear to hdparm to be in standby when they are not will
cause this utility to skip runnning the command for otherwise fully active
pools.
In some cases \fBhdparm -C\fR may cause USB drives in standby to wake
up, which defeats the purpose of this utility.
.PP
A possible workaround for both of these issues would be to not use
zzzrun on affected pool(s) and instead run the command manually as
required.
.PP
If \fBhdparm -C\fR returns "unknown" for a drive, \fB\*p\fR will interpret
this as active/idle and so err in favour of running the command.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The following exit values are returned:
.TP
.B 0
Successful completion.
.TP
.B 1
An error occurred.
.TP
.B 2
Invalid command line options were specified.
.TP
.B 3
No pools were available to process.
